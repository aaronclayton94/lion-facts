    <p>African lions are the largest of the African cats (second largest in the family Felidae, with the tiger being the largest). Males can reach a shoulder height of around 1.2 metres and weigh around 150 – 225 kg (av. 189kg). Females are around 1 metre in shoulder height, and weigh between 110-152kg (av. 126kg)</p>

    <p>African lions have a wide habitat, and can live almost everywhere – from open woodlands, thick bush, scrub and grass complexes, even penetrating deep into deserts along watercourses – though don’t expect to find them in rainforests. Globally, lions exist in Asia and in sub-Saharan Africa, though history shows that a long time ago lions also inhabited parts of southwest Asia and north Africa link  <br><a href="https://africageographic.com/blog/best-places-see-wild-lions-africa/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Read about</b> the best places to see wild lions in Africa</a></p>

    <p> The colour of a lion’s coat varies from region to region, and within populations. However, it is found that lions that live in areas where it is either cooler or have higher humidity levels tend to have darker fur – such as the desert-adapted lions in Namibia and the black-maned lions of the Kalahari. You also get white lions, but these are not true albinos but are rather genetic variants with strongly reduced pigmentation.</p>
